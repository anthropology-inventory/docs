# Anthropology Inventory Management Software Documentation

This repository contains all documentation for the Anthropology Inventory Management Software, developed in partnership with Madeleine Aguilar -- a professor working in the Department of Anthropology at Green River College.

It includes API documentation and setup guides to support ongoing development and maintenance.

## Repository Contents

## About the Project

This app was created in partnership with Madeleine Aguilar -- a professor working in the Department of Anthropology at Green River College. Its main purpose is to solve the growing need for digital inventory and archival of specimens.

## Contribution Guidelines

The `main` branches of either repository cannot be pushed to directly and will require a Pull Request before any code can be merged into `main`. This is becuase the current hosting setup will auto-deploy from the main branch of these repositories whenever a commit is pushed.
